# Decentralized-Chat
A serverless decentralized chat

This simple chat app shows the power of decentralization. A server only has to be port forwarded once after the network is active the server can be down and all hosts using the network will keep it alive even though they have not port forwarded this is because of the power of UDP hole punching.
